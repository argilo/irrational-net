<p>Well, it's the start of a new year, and I thought I'd start things off by finally getting off my butt and putting together a new web site.  I've had an <a href="http://www.argilo.net/">Esperanto site</a> for a few years now, but a lot of my friends don't speak Esperanto and have been asking for an English site.  I always thought maintaining two sites would be a pain, but thanks to a nice piece of content management software, <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, it should be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wish everyone all the best in 2006, and I hope to hear from you soon.  Leave a comment here or send me an email, and let me know what you're up to these days.</p>
