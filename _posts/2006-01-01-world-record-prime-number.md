Since 1998, I've been a participant in the [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://www.mersenne.org/), a project which aims to find huge prime numbers.  Just a couple weeks ago, the project broke the world record for the ninth straight time.  The record-setting number is 2<sup>30,402,457</sup>-1, which weighs in at 9,152,052 digits!  We're getting awfully close to finding a ten million digit prime and winning the [$100,000 prize](https://www.eff.org/awards/coop) offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

If you'd like to participate in the project as well, it's very simple.  Just download and install the [GIMPS software](https://www.mersenne.org/download/), which you won't even notice running in the background.  And who knows, you just might get lucky and win a share of that huge prize!
