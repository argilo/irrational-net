Recently I bought a Sangean HDR-14 radio, because I wanted to experiment with HD Radio emergency alerts. While some parts of the emergency alert system are described in the NRSC-5-E standard, important details are missing. For instance, the format of the control (CNT) data is not specified. As a result, some reverse engineering will be needed to bring emergency alert support to [gr-nrsc5](https://github.com/argilo/gr-nrsc5) and [nrsc5](https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5). The work is progressing well, and I've already added emergency alert encoding to gr-nrsc5. Control data decoding in nrsc5 should follow soon.

Firmware hacking
----------------

In [a previous post](/2024/03/25/hacking-a-sangean-hdt-20/), I extracted the firmware from a Sangean HDT-20 and modified it to add support for the [MP11 mode](https://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/digital-radio/the-story-of-the-fm-iboc-mp11-mode), which is missing in most receivers. Unsurprisingly, the HDR-14 also lacks support for MP11, so I decided to take a crack at adding it. The first step was to open the radio and have a look at the circuit board:

![interior view of a Sangean HDR-14 showing the locations of the JTAG port and SPI flash](/images/hdr-14-interior.jpg)

Like the HDT-20, this radio is based on an Atmel ATxmega192A3U microcontroller. Next to the microcontroller, a Winbond W25Q32JV 4 MB flash memory can be seen. (We'll come back to that later.) And below the AM antenna, beneath a piece of tape, are 10 solder pads which appear to be a JTAG port. I confirmed with a continuity tester that the pads are in fact connected to the microcontroller's JTAG pins, and soldered a 10-wire cable onto the pads so that I could connect my Atmel-ICE debugger.

It worked! Using the Microchip Studio Command Prompt on my Windows machine, I was able to extract the firmware with the following command:

```
atprogram -t atmelice -i jtag -d ATxmega192A3 read -fl -o 0x0 -s 0x30000 --format bin -f hdr14_app_section.bin
```

Back on my Linux machine, I converted the firmware dump to ELF and disassembled it:

```
avr-objcopy -I binary -O elf32-avr hdr14_app_section.bin hdr14_app_section.elf
avr-objdump -D hdr14_app_section.elf > hdr14_app_section.asm
```

In the disassembly, I found the same code fragment that I had patched in the HDT-20 firmware:

<pre>

   1927a:	70 91 ee 37 	lds	r23, 0x37EE

   1928a:	70 91 ea 37 	lds	r23, 0x37EA
   1928e:	81 e0       	ldi	r24, <b>0x01</b>
   19290:	91 e3       	ldi	r25, <b>0x31</b>

   19296:	60 91 e5 37 	lds	r22, 0x37E5
   1929a:	70 91 e6 37 	lds	r23, 0x37E6
   1929e:	82 e0       	ldi	r24, <b>0x02</b>
   192a0:	91 e3       	ldi	r25, <b>0x31</b>
   192a2:	0e 94 c6 7c 	call	<b>0xf98c</b>
   192a6:	60 e0       	ldi	r22, 0x00
   192a8:	70 e0       	ldi	r23, 0x00
   192aa:	81 e0       	ldi	r24, <b>0x01</b>
   192ac:	95 e3       	ldi	r25, <b>0x35</b>
   192ae:	0e 94 c6 7c 	call	<b>0xf98c</b>
</pre>

As before, this code sets the `FM_SEEK_BAND_BOTTOM` (0x3100), `FM_SEEK_BAND_TOP` (0x3101), `FM_SEEK_FREQUENCY_SPACING` (0x3102), and `FM_SOFTMUTE_SNR_ATTENUATION` (0x3501) properties. This time, the address of the `SET_PROPERTY` routine is 0xf98c.

Like with the HDT-20, we'll do the following:

1. Replace the code that sets the `FM_SOFTMUTE_SNR_ATTENUATION` property with a jump to a free address. We'll use address 0x2f000.
1. At that address, write some code that sets the `FM_SOFTMUTE_SNR_ATTENUATION` property as well as the `HD_SERVICE_MODE_CONTROL_MP11_ENABLE` property, then jumps back to address 0x192b2 (which is the address of the next instruction after the code fragment above).

We need only a single instruction to jump to address 0x2f000:

```
jmp 0x2f000
```

To assemble this and print the machine code in hexidecimal format, I ran the following:

```
avr-as -o patch1.o -mmcu=atxmega192a3 patch1.asm
avr-objcopy -O binary -j .text patch1.o patch1.bin
xxd -p patch1.bin
```

The final output is `0d940078`, which we will write at address 0x192a6, replacing two `ldi` instructions.

The code to set the two properties and jump back to address 0x192b2 is:

```
ldi  r22, 0x00
ldi  r23, 0x00
ldi  r24, 0x01
ldi  r25, 0x35
call 0xf98c
ldi  r22, 0x01
ldi  r23, 0x00
ldi  r24, 0x00
ldi  r25, 0x9A
call 0xf98c
jmp  0x192b2
```

After assembly, the final hexidecimal output is `60e070e081e095e30e94c67c61e070e080e09ae90e94c67c0c9459c9`, which we will write at address 0x2f000.

The final commands to patch the firmware using the Atmel-ICE debugger are:

```
atprogram -t atmelice -i jtag -d ATxmega192A3 write -fl -o 0x192a6 --values 0d940078
atprogram -t atmelice -i jtag -d ATxmega192A3 write -fl -o 0x2f000 --values 60e070e081e095e30e94c67c61e070e080e09ae90e94c67c0c9459c9
```

The patch works, and the radio can now receive all subchannels in an MP11 signal! ðŸŽ‰

If desired, the original firmware can be restored like so:

```
atprogram -t atmelice -i jtag -d ATxmega192A3 write -fl -o 0x192a6 --values 60e070e0
atprogram -t atmelice -i jtag -d ATxmega192A3 write -fl -o 0x2f000 --values ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
```

*Note:* These commands worked with my radio, which is running firmware HDR-14 P03. If your radio is running a different firmware version, it's likely that the memory addresses will need to be changed.

Flash memory
------------

Now let's return to the Winbond flash memory chip mentioned above. According to the datasheet, it's a serial NOR flash. The Raspberry Pi has a SPI interface, and it should be possible to connect to the chip using the `flashrom` utility.

After enabling the SPI interface in `raspi-config` (Interface Options â†’ SPI) and connecting the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins to the flash chip (following the [instructions in the flashrom wiki](https://wiki.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi#Connecting_the_flash_chip), and using the test clips that came with my Saleae logic analyzer), I was able to extract the flash memory:

```
flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=1000 -r hdr14_flash.bin
```

The `binwalk` utility didn't identify anything in the dump, so I used its "entropy" mode to visualize the data:

```
binwalk -E hdr14_flash.bin
```

![entropy analysis of HDR-14 flash memory](/images/hdr-14-flash-entropy.png)

In the first megabyte, two high-entropy chunks can be seen. The next megabyte is a chunk with varying entropy, and the final two megabytes are empty.

With `hexdump`, we can see that the first two chunks are very likely firmware for the Si468x HD Radio receiver chip:

```
00000000  53 49 4c 41 42 53 5f 46  4c 41 53 48 70 de 07 00  |SILABS_FLASHp...|

```

```

It makes sense that there would be two of them; one for FM and one for AM.

Then beginning at offset 0x102000 is the mixed-entropy chunk:

```

```

I suspected this might be sound files for the emergency alert announcements ("Weather Alert", "Safety Alert", etc.) This turned out to be correct, as I was able to play back the audio by piping the data into aplay:

```
tail -c +1056769 hdr14_flash.bin | aplay -f S16_LE -r 16000
```

I heard "Alert, Down, 8, 80, Environmental Alert, ..." There was a small amount of noise at the beginning, so I had a closer look and noticed that there appear to be 41 little-endian integers encoded at the start. Decoding them, we get:

40, 22528, 16384, 16384, 14336, 47104, ...

40 is the number of recordings, and the numbers that follow are their lengths. With a bit of Python, the recordings can be dumped into WAV files:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import struct
import wave

SOUNDS_OFFSET = 0x00102000
SOUND_NAMES = [
    "alert",
    "down",
    "8",
    "80",
    "environmental_alert",
    "fire_alert",
    "5",
    "4",
    "geophysical_alert",
    "hazmat_alert",
    "hd",
    "health_alert",
    "9",
    "90",
    "non_specific_alert",
    "off",
    "on",
    "1",
    "point",
    "preset",
    "rescue_alert",
    "safety_alert",
    "security_alert",
    "seek_down",
    "seek_up",
    "7",
    "70",
    "6",
    "test_alert",
    "3",
    "transportation_alert",
    "tune_down",
    "tune_up",
    "2",
    "up",
    "utilities_alert",
    "weather_alert",
    "0",
    "beep1",
    "beep2",
]

with open("hdr14_flash.bin", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()

offset = SOUNDS_OFFSET

num_sounds = struct.unpack("<I", data[offset:offset+4])[0]
offset += 4

sound_lens = []
for _ in range(num_sounds):
    sound_lens.append(struct.unpack("<I", data[offset:offset+4])[0])
    offset += 4

for sound_len, sound_name in zip(sound_lens, SOUND_NAMES):
    sound_data = data[offset:offset+sound_len]
    offset += sound_len

    w = wave.open(f"{sound_name}.wav", "wb")
    w.setnchannels(1)
    w.setsampwidth(2)
    w.setframerate(16000)
    w.writeframes(sound_data)
    w.close()
```

In addition to the emergency alert messages, there are also recordings for voice prompts ("seek up", "seek down", "preset", etc). I suspect these are unused, because the HDR-14 does not appear to have a voice prompt feature. It could be that the same flash memory is used in more than one Sangean model.

It would be fun to swap out the alert sounds with custom versions and write those back to the flash chip, but I'll leave that project for another day.
