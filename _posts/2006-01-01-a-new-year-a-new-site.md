Well, it's the start of a new year, and I thought I'd start things off by finally getting off my butt and putting together a new web site.  I've had an [Esperanto site](https://argilo.net/) for a few years now, but a lot of my friends don't speak Esperanto and have been asking for an English site.  I always thought maintaining two sites would be a pain, but thanks to a nice piece of content management software, [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), it should be a piece of cake.

Anyway, I wish everyone all the best in 2006, and I hope to hear from you soon.  Leave a comment here or send me an email, and let me know what you're up to these days.
