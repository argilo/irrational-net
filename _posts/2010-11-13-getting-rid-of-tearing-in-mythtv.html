<p>I just upgraded to MythTV 0.24, and so far it's looking great!  Closed captions look much nicer and the revamped on-screen display looks very sharp.  But one problem I'd seen occasionally in 0.23 seemed to be worse: tearing in video playback.  I used to see tearing only occasionally in HD playback, but after the upgrade I started to see it more frequently, and in SD playback as well.  After a bit of quick googling, I found a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/VDPAU#Tearing.2FStuttering">solution</a> in the MythTV wiki.  I added the following to my frontend's /etc/X11/xorg.conf file:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>Section "Extensions"<br />
	Option "Composite" "Disable"<br />
EndSection</code></p></blockquote>
<p>After a quick restart, the tearing was completely gone.  Yay!</p>
