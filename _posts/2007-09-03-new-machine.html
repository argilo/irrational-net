<p>I've been thinking about building myself a new desktop machine for a while now, but I finally got around to it this weekend after the motherboard in my old machine failed.  Here's what's in the new one:
<ul>
<li>Intel Core 2 Duo E6750 (2.66 GHz)</li>
<li>Asus P5K-V (1333 MHz FSB, integrated video)</li>
<li>2GB Corsair Twin2X PC2-6400 (4-4-4-12)</li>
<li>Antec Solo case</li>
<li>Corsair VX450 power supply</li>
<li>WD Caviar 500 GB SATA hard drive</li>
<li>Asus DRW-1814BLT SATA DVD burner</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has a few components from my old machine, namely a 250 GB PATA hard drive, Hauppauge HVR-1600 ATSC/NTSC tuner card, and M-Audio Omni sound card.</p>
<p>Initially I was experiencing choppy sound and mouse movement whenever the hard drive was active, but I solved the problem by downloading the latest drivers for the JMicron PATA/SATA controller from the manufacturer's website.  Also, the memory was running at 5-5-5-18 timings by default, but I easily fixed that in BIOS.  I used Norton Ghost to move Windows to my new SATA hard drive.</p>
<p>This machine is smokin'!  Prime95 is running about three times as fast as before, and I can't believe how fast BeyondTV starts up.  The new case is great too.  It has way better ventilation than my old one, and I love having USB ports and audio jacks on the front!</p>
