<p>Well, the <a href="http://esm.ubc.ca">Election Stock Market</a> closed last night, and final prices would put the parties as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Liberal: <strong>93</strong><br />
Conservative: <strong>127</strong><br />
NDP: <strong>33</strong><br />
Bloc Quebecois: <strong>54</strong><br />
Others: <strong>1</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.electionprediction.org">Election Prediction Project</a>, which does a riding-by-riding analysis based on user-submitted commentaries, calls for:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Liberal: <strong>104</strong><br />
Conservative: <strong>118</strong><br />
NDP: <strong>29</strong><br />
Bloc Quebecois: <strong>56</strong><br />
Others: <strong>1</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Things are looking good for the NDP, but then again, the Election Prediction Project greatly overestimated the NDP last time, so I'm not getting my hopes up.  In any case, it looks like Teodora and I will end up about $20 ahead in the stock market!</p>
