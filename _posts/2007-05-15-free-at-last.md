It's been a month now since all my Rogers services were canceled, and I couldn't be happier.  The [National Capital Freenet](https://www.ncf.ca/) is providing me with great DSL service at a great price, and over-the-air television is working out wonderfully thanks to my digital/analog TV tuner card.  Watching the Senators destroy the Sabres in high definition is great.  :-)
