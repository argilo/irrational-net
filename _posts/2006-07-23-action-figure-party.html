<p>A while ago, I was fooling around with a couple of the music recommendation services, Last.fm and Pandora.  They didn't suggest much interesting, with one notable exception: Action Figure Party.  I heard their song "Everybody Ready" and loved it.  I just received their CD, and I'm pleased to report that the rest of the tracks don't disappoint.  In fact, I've listened to most of them at least five times now, and love them more with each listen.  "Where's The Moment", "Clock Radio", and "Action Figure Party" are also exceptional tracks.  There's tons of vintage instruments: Arp, Moog, Wurlitzer, Hammond, Rhodes, Clavinet, you name it.  One track even has some theremin.  Definitely check it out if you're into funky, jazzy music.</p>
