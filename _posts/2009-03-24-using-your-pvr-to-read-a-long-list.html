<p>Tonight I watched the season finale of the Rick Mercer Report.  It was a pretty normal episode, but one of the jokes nearly made me fall off my chair.  It was in a spoof ad for "COLD-fX Drip", an intravenous version of the medication once hawked by Don Cherry.  Near the end of the spoof, a list of things you can do while using the medication zoomed by on the screen.  Since I have a PVR, I jumped back 10 seconds to watch the list in slow motion to see if anything funny was in it.  Lo and behold, Rick had anticipated my move!  As it turns out, COLD-fX Drip is great to use while "using your PVR to read a long list!"</p>
<p>Here's a screen capture for your amusement:</p>
