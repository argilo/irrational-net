For the first time in my life, I've voted for the winning candidate in an election, namely [Paul Dewar](https://pauldewar.ca/) of the NDP!  In fact, he ended up winning by a fairly large margin, which surprised me.  Another surprising thing is that the NDP ended up with more seats than ever in Ontario!

Below are the final results.  As you can see, both predictions came very close.  Teodora and I ended up making about $27 on the stock market, which is not bad interest for an investment of $400 over a month!

> Liberal: **103**  
> Conservative: **124**  
> NDP: **29**  
> Bloc Quebecois: **51**  
> Others: **1**
