<p>I was starting to get tired of Drupal, so I thought I'd switch my blog over to WordPress.  So far I'm impressed.  The installation was simple, and I was up and running in minutes.  I thought of using a script to copy my old blog postings over, but since there weren't many I just did it by hand.  Now I'm putting the finishing touches on.  Please let me know if you notice any problems.</p>
