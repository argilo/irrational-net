<p>Since 1998, I've been a participant in the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search</a>, a project which aims to find huge prime numbers.  Just a couple weeks ago, the project broke the world record for the ninth straight time.  The record-setting number is 2<sup>30,402,457</sup>-1, which weighs in at 9,152,052 digits!  We're getting awfully close to finding a ten million digit prime and winning the <a href="http://www.eff.org/awards/coop.php">$100,000 prize</a> offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>
<p>If you'd like to participate in the project as well, it's very simple.  Just download and install the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm">GIMPS software</a>, which you won't even notice running in the background.  And who knows, you just might get lucky and win a share of that huge prize!</p>
