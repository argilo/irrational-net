<p>For the first time in my life, I've voted for the winning candidate in an election, namely <a href="http://www.pauldewar.ca/">Paul Dewar</a> of the NDP!  In fact, he ended up winning by a fairly large margin, which surprised me.  Another surprising thing is that the NDP ended up with more seats than ever in Ontario!</p>
<p>Below are the final results.  As you can see, both predictions came very close.  Teodora and I ended up making about $27 on the stock market, which is not bad interest for an investment of $400 over a month!</p>
<blockquote><p>
Liberal: <strong>103</strong><br />
Conservative: <strong>124</strong><br />
NDP: <strong>29</strong><br />
Bloc Quebecois: <strong>51</strong><br />
Others: <strong>1</strong>
